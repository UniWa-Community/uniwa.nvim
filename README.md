# Install

```lua
-- with lazy
{
    'UniWa-Community/uniwa.nvim',
}
```

# Usage

```vim
colorscheme uniwa
```

---

## Lualine

```lua
require("lualine").setup({
    theme = "uniwa"
})

```

# Building the colorscheme from source

First off it requires the following plugins to be installed:

* [lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim)

* [shipwright](https://github.com/rktjmp/shipwright.nvim)

```lua
'rktjmp/shipwright.nvim',
'rktjmp/lush.nvim',
```

After installing them, you can run `:Shipwright` in the repo's root directory, which will generate:

* a lua colorscheme in `./colors/uniwa.lua`

* a lualine theme in `./lua/lualine/themes/uniwa.lua`
